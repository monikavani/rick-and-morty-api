# Leonardo.ai test 🌌

Thank you for reviewing my implementation of this technical task!

I found the requirements clear and well-structured, which allowed me to focus on building a production-ready solution. The project was particularly enjoyable as it touched on key web development concepts:

Authentication flow with persistent user data

GraphQL integration with Apollo Client

Responsive UI using Chakra UI

Clean state management with Context API

## I'd love to hear your feedback on:

My architectural decisions, Areas for improvement etc.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
